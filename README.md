## Project Overview                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The primary goal of the High Cloud Airline Data Analytics Project is to enhance operational efficiency, optimize revenue, 
and improve customer satisfaction through comprehensive data analysis. 
This involves collecting, processing, and analyzing various data sources related to the airline’s operations, customers, and market trends to derive actionable insights.
Marketing focuses on matching customers with the products or services that satisfy some of their needs. 
Essential elements of marketing include analysis of the target market, market segmentation, targeting the chosen customer segments, positioning of products and services, 
etc.

The purpose of this analysis in the context of airline industry is to discuss key external factors influencing airline industry, to identify market segments in airline 
industry and explain these segments using the marketing concepts of segmentation, targeting and positioning.


Airline industry consists of several segments: passenger airline industry, military, cargo carriers, etc 
(Structure of the airline industry, n.d.). In the context of this analysis passenger airline industry will be considered. 
## Data Source
Airline Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the “Airline Dataset.csv,” containing detailed information about airline operations.
## Tools Used
### Excel: 
Data Cleaning
### SQL: 
Data Analysis
### Power BI: 
Creating Reports
### Tableau: 
Creating Interactive Reports

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:

Data loading and inspection

Handling missing values

Data cleaning and formatting

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis was conducted using SQL, focusing on answerng questions about Key Performance Indicators such as:

Load Factor

Transported Passengers

Total Count of Airlines

## Key Features of the Dashboard
Dashboard: Provides insights into various factors like Load Factor, Transported Passengers, and Total Count of Airlines, with filters for sorting data.
Flight Search Page: Allows searching for specific flights or passenger details by day, destination, carrier name, etc.

## Results/Findings
1.Passenger trends over the past year

2.Load Factor by different parameters

3.Top Airlines by different parameters

4.Customer satisfaction metrics

5.Top-performing routes by profitability

6.Distance traveled by flights

## Recommendations
### 1.Optimize Route Frequencies
High-Demand Routes: Focus on routes with consistently high load factors.
If the Atlanta to New York route sees an increase in flights, it could boost revenue by 15-20% due to higher passenger volumes.

### 2.Enhance Carrier Services
Top Carriers: Improve services for carriers with high load factors.
This could result in a 5-10% increase in repeat bookings and a higher Net Promoter Score (NPS).

### 3. Peak Periods: 
Utilize data on peak travel times to optimize scheduling and promotions.
Optimizing schedules and promotions for July could lead to a 10-15% increase in ticket sales.

### 4. Load Factor Analysis: 
Adjust flight schedules based on load factor trends. 

### 5. Turnaround Times: 
Analyze and reduce aircraft turnaround times to increase fleet utilization. 

### 6. Dynamic Pricing: 
Implement dynamic pricing strategies based on demand fluctuations.
For instance, if passenger demand is projected to increase by 10% during the holiday season, adjust ticket prices accordingly to maximize revenue.

### 7. Customer Experience
Satisfaction Scores: Focus on improving areas with lower customer satisfaction scores.
If the Net Promoter Score (NPS) is 70, aim to increase it to 75 by enhancing in-flight services and customer support.

### 8. Sustainability Initiatives
Fuel Efficiency: Invest in more fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce carbon emissions.


By implementing these recommendations, High Cloud Airline can enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.
